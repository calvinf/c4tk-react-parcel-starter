# React Starter Using Parcel

## Environment setup

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/)
* Install [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
* Fork this repository
* Clone your fork to your computer
* Run `yarn install` in the directory
* Run `yarn start` to launch `index.html` in development mode

## Getting Started

* `index.html` is your main HTML file where the [React](https://reactjs.org/) app will be initialized
* `assets/hello.js` contains a starting point for your [React](https://reactjs.org/) app
* `assets/hello.scss` contains a starting point for your styles using [SCSS (Sass)](http://sass-lang.com/).

## Running

* Dev: `yarn start` -- Parcel supports "Hot Module Reloading" so you can save an update, open the browser, and it will automatically update
* Build: `yarn build` -- generate the "production" build
* Serve: `yarn serve` -- serves the "production" build
